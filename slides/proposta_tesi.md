## Scaletta tesi

##### What you have done so far

- Literature review on DT;
- Identified a case study for a Digital Twin in precision agriculture domain.
- In the same domain, in a PNRR Agritech project a data platform integrating stakeholders data has been implemented, thus allowing to consider more heterogeneous data (e.g. satellite imagery)
- Implemented such DT and conducted a phase of data related requirements analysis, through which emerged:
    - Time related requirements (in both ingestion and fruition)
    - Expressiveness requirements: heterogeneus data from heterogeneous sources
    - Highly dynamical aspect of relationships between DT entities and sensors.
- Literature review on data architectures that tailor such requirements individually;
- W.r.t. identified requirements, a query workload entailing such requirements has been defined;
- Given literature review outcome, worked on identifying a new data structure that could fulfill such requirements.

##### What you plan to do in the two years that remain

- Ultimate and implement the defined data structure
- Deploy the agriculture DT on top of such data structure to efficiently collect and store DT data.
- Evaluate the data structure performance with the previously defined query workload upon data collected from DT.
- From such evaluation, understand proposed data structure's limits and work towards optimization of such.

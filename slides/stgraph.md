# STGraph - A spatio-temporal graph for time-series modelling

## STGraph - Overview

- <b>Graph DBMSs</b> are optimized for high-performance <i>entity traversal</i>;
    - Natively built on **index-free adjacency principles**.
- <b>Time-Series DBMSs</b> are designed for <i>high-throughput temporal ingestion</i> and efficient management of <i>time-structured data</i>;
    - Natively built on **Log-Structured Merge Tree** based data structures.

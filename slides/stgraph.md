# STGraph - A spatio-temporal graph for time-series modelling

## STGraph - Overview

- <b>Graph DBMSs</b>
    - Natively built on **index-free adjacency principles**;
    - Optimized for high-performance <i>entity traversal</i>;
    - Efficient on <i>small-volume datasets</i> .
- <b>Time-Series DBMSs</b>
    - Natively built on **Log-Structured Merge Tree** based data structures;
    - Optimized for <i>high-throughput temporal ingestion</i> and efficient management of <i>time-ordered data</i>;
    - Efficient on <i>large-volume datasets</i>.

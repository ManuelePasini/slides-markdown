# STGraph - A spatio-temporal graph for time-series modelling

## STGraph - Overview

- <b>Graph DBMSs</b> are optimized for high-performance entity traversal;
    - Usually built on data structures implementing **index-free adjacency principles**.
- <b>Time-Series DBMSs</b> are are designed for high-throughput temporal ingestion and efficient management of time-structured data;
    - Usually built on **Log-Structured Merge Tree** based data structures.

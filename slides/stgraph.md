# STGraph - A spatio-temporal graph for time-series modelling

## STGraph - Overview

- Graph DBMSs are optimized for high-performance entity traversal;
    - Usually built on index-free adjacency principles.
- Time-Series DBMSs are are designed for high-throughput temporal ingestion and efficient management of time-structured data;
    - Usually built on Log-Structured Merge Trees.

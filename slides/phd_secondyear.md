# Architectures and Methods for Digital Twin Platforms

## Introduction to Digital Twins

 - Differences between digital shadow, digital model, Digital Twin (DT)
 - Still a buzzword, but enclosing on a definition...
 - 3 components: phyisical model, virtual model, communication services

## Introduction to Digital Twins

- While concept of data as a core component is arising..
- ... Still left unconsidered in most research papers.
- ... However, some standard models are emerging
- e.g.: Fei Tao, Univ. of Beijing

## A Digital Twin for Precision Agriculture

- Five year ongoing project (also in PNRR - Spoke 9) in precision irrigation of orchards
- Demo available at https://big.csr.unibo.it/projects/smarter/
- Scientific Article submitted to Computer and Electronics in Agriculture (September 2025).

## A Data Platform fostering collaboration between DTs

- Within PNRR Agritech - Spoke 3, building a Data Platform fostering collaboration and integration between research projects...
- While defining integration policies and standards...
- Some key data requirements emerged:

    - <b>Heterogeneous data</b>: encompassing structured and unstructured types, including images.

    - <b>Interconnected data</b>: representing both physical entities and the IoT networks describing them.

    - <b>Temporal aspects</b>: datasets often exhibit time-series behavior.

    - <b>Spatial aspects</b>: data are frequently geolocated.

- **Currently working on its implementation**

## From application-oriented to domain-oriented

- A DT can be characterized by the data pipelines that collect, process, and generate insights from data.
- Is it possible, given a data pipeline, to determine the set of a data platform services enibling such pipeline?

# Digital Twins (DT)
 - Buzzword
 - Rising number of publications
 - Still no universally adopted vision
 - Focus on last state!

 # DT in academia

 - Mostly manufacturing, smart cities, health domain
 - Still mostly application oriented
 - but, concept of data as a core component is arising
 - Fei Fao, Univ. Beijing - aerospace (metti img architett dt)

 # DT in industry
  <b>Azure Digital Twin</b>
  - FIWARE like
  - Digital Twin Definition Language (NGSI-LD, JSON-LD)
  - Offers interfaces to control the physical device (not supported)
  - Native support for a time series db
  - Not clear if it facilitates or provides integration with Azure big data services.

  <b>AWS Twin Maker</b>
  - Similar to
   Azure Digital twins
  - more user friendly

 # DT Data - Modeling
 - Mostly graphs
 - Initially pure linked data and semantic graphs (RDF, ontologies)
 - New standards (JSON-LD, NGSI-LD) to seamelessly integrate semi-structured data, graphs and semantic graphs (also supported by RDF)
 - e.g. Azure Digital Twin, AWS Twin Maker

 # DT Data - Architectures
  - Most papers don't even mention it!
  - When they do, they focus on entities last-state.
  - Is it really different from a Lambda-like big data architecture?
  - e.g. Digital Twin Data (Fei Tao)
 
 # DT Data - Lifecycle
 - Something is starting to pop out (Fei, Tao metti immagine)
 - "Trash" literature (non IT academics)
 - Are we reinventing the wheel?h



# What next?
